=head1 NAME

POE::Filter::Block - translate data between streams and blocks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!perl

  use warnings;
  use strict;
  use POE::Filter::Block;

  my $filter = POE::Filter::Block->new( BlockSize => 8 );

  # Prints three lines: abcdefgh, ijklmnop, qrstuvwx.
  # Bytes "y" and "z" remain in the buffer and await completion of the
  # next 8-byte block.

  $filter->get_one_start([ "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" ]);
  while (1) {
    my $block = $filter->get_one();
    last unless @$block;
    print $block->[0], "\n";
  }

  # Print one line: yz123456

  $filter->get_one_start([ "123456" ]);
  while (1) {
    my $block = $filter->get_one();
    last unless @$block;
    print $block->[0], "\n";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Filter::Block translates data between serial streams and blocks.
It can handle fixed-length and length-prepended blocks, and it may be
extended to handle other block types.

Fixed-length blocks are used when Block's constructor is called with a
BlockSize value.  Otherwise the Block filter uses length-prepended
blocks.

Users who specify block sizes less than one deserve what they get.

In variable-length mode, a LengthCodec parameter may be specified.
The LengthCodec value should be a reference to a list of two
functions: the length encoder, and the length decoder:

  LengthCodec => [ \&encoder, \&decoder ]

The encoder takes a reference to a buffer and prepends the buffer's
length to it.  The default encoder prepends the ASCII representation
of the buffer's length and a chr(0) byte to separate the length from
the actual data:

  sub _default_encoder {
    my $stuff = shift;
    substr($$stuff, 0, 0) = length($$stuff) . "\0";
    return;
  }

The corresponding decoder returns the block length after removing it
and the separator from the buffer.  It returns nothing if no length
can be determined.

  sub _default_decoder {
    my $stuff = shift;
    unless ($$stuff =~ s/^(\d+)\0//s) {
      warn length($1), " strange bytes removed from stream"
        if $$stuff =~ s/^(\D+)//s;
      return;
    }
    return $1;
  }

This filter holds onto incomplete blocks until they are completed in a
framing buffer.  To control memory usage, a maximum framing buffer size is
imposed.  This maximum size defaults to 512 MB (512*1024*1024 octets).  You
may change this size limit with the C<MaxBuffer> parameter.

    MaxBuffer => 1099511627776  # One terabyte!

The size of each individual block is also limited.  By default, each block
may be no more then 64 MB.  You may change this size limit with the
C<MaxLength> parameter.

    MaxLength => 10             # small blocks

Remember that MaxBuffer needs to be larger then MaxLength.  What's more, it
needs to have room for the length prefix.

If either the C<MaxLength> or C<MaxBuffer> constraint is exceeded,
C<POE::Filter::Bock> will throw an exception.
