POE::Component::IRC::Cookbook::Disconnecting - How to disconnect gracefully
with PoCo-IRC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Shutting down an IRC bot can be quick and messy, or slow and graceful.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are two ways you can shut down an IRC bot/client. The quick and dirty way
is rather simple:

 exit;

It exits the program, shutting down the socket, and everybody online sees yet
another "Connection reset by peer" or "Remote end closed the socket" or
something.

As of version 6.50, all you need to do in order to shut down gracefully is to
send a L<C<shutdown>|POE::Component::IRC/shutdown> event to the IRC component.
It will make sure your quit message (if any) gets delivered, and will forcibly
disconnect if there are any problems (faulty server or network issues). After
doing this, it will unregister all sessions and clean up after itself.

If you want to do something more elaborate on your own, take a look at
the following documentation: L<logged in|POE::Component::IRC/logged_in>,
L<C<connected>|POE::Component::IRC/connected>,
L<C<quit>|POE::Component::IRC/quit>,
L<C<disconnect>|POE::Component::IRC/disconnect>, and
L<C<unregister>|POE::Component::IRC/unregister>.
